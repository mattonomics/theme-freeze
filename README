# Theme Freeze

Theme Freeze is a simple, option free plugin that "freezes" the current WordPress theme for logged out visitors. This allows you to test drive other themes that may be too complex for WordPress Live Preview.

## How To Install

1. Install like any other plugin.
2. Activate Theme Freeze with the theme you would like visitors to see set as the active theme.
3. Activate a different theme and have your way with it.
